### Hello there, I'm Garcia Milord 👋

#### Software Engineer

Currently at Oracle, I work on scalable financial integrations, where my goal is to simplify complex workflows through clean, reliable engineering. My journey has given me solid experience in ERP integrations, API development, and creating resilient systems.

### 💡 My Drive

I'm driven by a curiosity for how systems work and a passion for creating impactful solutions. I'm especially interested in these areas:

* **Cloud & DevOps:** Building resilient systems using cloud-native services and modern DevOps principles.
* **FinTech:** Exploring the world of financial technology and high-scale infrastructure.
* **Problem-Solving:** Designing APIs and integrations that directly address real-world business challenges.

I believe in **lifelong learning** and am always exploring new frameworks and technologies to build better, more meaningful solutions.
